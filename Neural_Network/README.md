Glossary
* AI - artificial intelligence - simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
* ML - machine learning - part of AI. Main goal: using AI to create an automatic system that can improve itself with the help of accumulated experience (i.e. data) and acquiring new knowledge on this basis. Dramatically simplifying example: an artificial neural network without supervised (or partially unsupervised) learning with addition of GA to generate samples.
* TLU - Threshold Logic Uni - simple artificial neuron, look at catalogue 00.
* LTU - Linear Threshold Unit - simple artificial neuron, look at catalogue 00.
* MCP - McCullochâ€“Pitts Neuron - TODO
* threshold neuron - look at MCP
* Perceptron - Rosenbalt pereceptron - most basic neural network build from one or more MCP with. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron

* AF - activation function - y = f(s) where s = bias + dot(inputs, weights), defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs. Many times used in  extracellular electrical field. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function
* TF - transfer function - activation function but for linear system's. 
* BP - backpropagation - algorithm in training feedforward neural networks for supervised learning. It re-verse feedforwad https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation
* GD - Gradient Descent - first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent
* SSE - squared errors - TODO


* GA - genetic algorithm - TODO

* linear regions - they are regions you can divide by drawing straight line.
* non-linear regions - they are regions you can not divide by drawing straight line.

* sample - a set of individuals or objects collected or selected from a statistical population by a defined procedure.
* deep learning - TODO
* machine vision - TODO
* data science - TODO
* data mining - related to ML field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.
* multi-dimensional entry - multivariate random variable or random vector is a list of mathematical variables each of whose value is unknown, either because the value has not yet occurred or because there is imperfect knowledge of its value.
* multivariate data - multi-dimensional entry  
* Iris flower data set -
