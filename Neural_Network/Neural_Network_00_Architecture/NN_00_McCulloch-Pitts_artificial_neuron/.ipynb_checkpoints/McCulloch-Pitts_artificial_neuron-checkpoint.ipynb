    "The are many ways of implementation the model of McCulloch-Pitts threshold neuron (1943). \n",

    "McCulloch-Pitts artificial neuron gets on start inputs, weights and bias.\n",
    "Inputs may be different in \"lifetime\", weights will change in process of learning of artificial neuron and we can change the bias to make corrections if we see the learning process is not going right.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE:\n",
    "We can treat our input as a result of our answer on the test. 0 means we gave the wrong answer and 1 means our answer on the test was correct.\n",
    "We can treat weights as values for each question in test how importa. \n",
    "Also we can treat bias as a border below each we do not pass the students."
